Problem:
Let's design a Pastebin like web service, where users can store plain text. Users of the service will enter a piece of text and get a randomly generated URL to access it.

Functional requirements:
1. User must be able to submit text and receive a random URL for that text
2. Random URL must be unique
3. URL must be accessible to public
4. URL expires after a default or custom duration
5. User can pick a custom name for their random URL

Non-functional requirements:
1. Links must be unpredictable
2. Server and database must be highly available and reliable
3. URL access should be low-latency

Assumptions:
1. Read-heavy
2. Medium-sized storage for many small snippets of texts

API:

POST /url

request = {
    text: String
    name: Optional | String
    expireDate: Optional | Datetime
}

response = {
    shortURL: String
}

Throw error: Serverside failure or not a string
Notes: Creates URL to pasted text

DELETE /url

request = {

}

response = {
    text: String
}

Throw error: Serverside failure or invalid key
Notes: Deletes URL to pasted text
